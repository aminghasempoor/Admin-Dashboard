## Getting Started
Admin Dashboard that works with role and permission

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Dashboard using :
Nextjs14, Typescript, zod, ReactHookForm, ...
In this project, I will direct each user to their respective dashboard based on their role and permissions.
Each user can perform actions based on role and permissions.
Dashboard is one of the most important parts of any website in the business domain.
